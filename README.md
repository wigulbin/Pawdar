This is the final project for my Advnaed Web Design class I took at Rutgers. The goal was to create a web application using three apis. I chose to use the Rescue Groups API: https://rescuegroups.org/services/adoptable-pet-data-api/ as well as the Google Maps API. For the third API I decided to instead set up a mySQL instance on AWS and at the moment is used to store user information, however as of now it is still missing certain functionality such as hashing passwords for the database. I will be continuing to expand on this project for the forseeable future as there are still features I would have liked to add that did not make it into the version submitted for school.
